The research of Secure Multi-Party Computation is mainly aimed at the problem of how to safely calculate a contracted function without a trusted third party. Secure multi-party computation is the cryptographic basis for the implementation of many applications such as electronic elections, threshold signatures, and electronic auctions.
A secure multi-party computation protocol is called information-theoretic security or unconditional security if it is safe for an attacker with infinite computing power; if it is safe for an attacker with polynomial computing power, it is called a cipher Learning to be safe or conditionally safe.
The existing results prove that under the unconditional security model, if and only when the number of malicious participants is less than 1/3 of the total number, a secure scheme exists. However, under the conditional security model, if and only if the number of malicious participants is less than half of the total number, a secure scheme exists.
Secure multi-party computation originated from Yao Zhizhi's millionaire problem in 1982. Later, Oded Goldreich had a more detailed and systematic exposition.
